WSGI options
============

.. sidebar:: Build now

    Run buildout for this section:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        buildout -c options.cfg

The following options affect the contents of the `wsgi.ini` file generated by `plone.recipe.zope2instance`.

http-address
------------

You can specify both a simple port (e.g. 9090) or a socket (e.g. 127.0.0.1:9090) with this option.
The default is to listen on 0.0.0.0:8080.

.. note::

    Setting this to an empty string (as proposed in outdated p.r.zope2instance documentation in order to run Zope under an external server) will result in a flaky
    listen directive in wsgi.ini (`listen = 0.0.0.0:`)
    Waitress will open on a random non-privileged port in this case.

threads (vs zserver-threads)
----------------------------

The new `threads` option specifies the number of worker threads for both WSGI and ZServer.
The WSGI default is 4 threads since this is the waitress default.
The ZServer default of two threads remains unchanged.

wsgi
----

debug-exceptions
----------------

Use WSGI middleware debugging facilities.

http-fast-listen
----------------

Options that are currently unavailable for WSGI
-----------------------------------------------

ip-address, ftp-address, icp-address, webdav-address/webdav-force-connection-close, http-header-max-length.

asyncio vs async - tbd
----------------------

asyncio: Python wrapper for the select and poll system calls.
