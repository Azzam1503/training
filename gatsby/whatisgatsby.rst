What Is GatsbyJS
================

`GatsbyJS <https://www.gatsbyjs.org/>`_ is a modern static site generator for React.

It uses a stack of cutting-edge technologies:

- Babel
- ReactJS
- Webpack
- GraphQL

Using these technologies combined together, GatsbyJS allows developers to easily develop their websites with modern best-practices and tools:

- Code splitting, responsive images, etc
- Componentization
- Hot reloading
- One-directional data flow
- ES6 + ES7 automatically transpiled 
- PWA

GatsbyJS sets up a project using the latest technologies which pulls data from almost any source at all and generates a static site, just by whipping together a couple of Gatsby plugins together or directly with all configuration by using a starter.

That is how it is developer friendly, but it even has a lot of benefits practically too! Static sites mean you do not need to worry about complex server setup maintenance and scaling, you can just lift them into a CDN and make the site available as quick as possible to the users wherever they are.
