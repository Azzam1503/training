gatsby-starter-plone
===================

gatsby-starter-plone comes with gatsby-source-plone and everything else already configured and setup.

This makes sure you do not waste time on the configuration and can focus directly on building your site.

Let us try out the `gatsby-source-plone <https://github.com/collective/gatsby-source-plone/>`_ plugin with our `gatsby-starter-plone <https://github.com/collective/gatsby-starter-plone/>`_ to instantly kickstart GatsbyJS development with Plone.

With the GatsbyJS CLI installed, starting up is as simple as:

.. code-block:: console

  gatsby new gatsby-plone-training https://github.com/collective/gatsby-starter-plone
  

This is will setup a GatsbyJS project in the gatsby-plone-training folder with gatsby-source-plone setup already along with a couple of useful extra features.

To see the starter along with the plugin in action, just run the following commands and navigate to ``localhost:8000``.

.. code-block:: console

  cd gatsby-plone-training
  gatsby develop

Yes! Simple as that we have a GatsbyJS site sourced from a Plone site up and running.

Take time exploring the Gatsby site generated and compare it to the Plone site at https://plonedemo.kitconcept.com/en/.

Notice that we have tried to keep them as similar as possible.
