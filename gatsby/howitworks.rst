How it works
============

Static site means that it serves a set of static pages that don't need any kind
of calc: the client simply ask a specific page to the server, and he deliver it without
any additional query/data elaboration.

The power of GatsbyJS is that it can fetch data from a set of sources like files 
(text files, csv, etc) or CMS, and then build them and generate static pages with that data, ready to be served.
