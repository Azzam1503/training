Welcome to Mastering Plone's documentation!
===========================================

Please note, this document is not a public one. It is the documentation that people get who attend a "Mastering Plone"-Training with us. Even though we attempt to include the most important parts of what we teach in this documentation it can not be considered complete without the spoken word.

A more formal documentation that we use quite often is here http://developer.plone.org/index.html. This document is not better or more complete than the one above.

While we want to teach you something, we also want to make it entertaining. In some parts of the document, we might be a slight exageration or bad mouthing. We hope that during our presentation, it came quite clear that we hate nothing of it, but if you only have your eyes to digest the information, this might get lost, and we do not want to explain ourselves to people who might get offended by the words chosen.

If you did not read the document yet, don't worry, we will not be swearing in the document or use ugly words. In theory you could read this document to your kids, it contains no mature only words, thus it stayed immature. Or something like that.
