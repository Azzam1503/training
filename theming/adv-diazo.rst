Advanced Diazo

    **"Diazo allows you to apply a theme contained in a static HTML web page to a dynamic website created using any server-side technology."**

To do this diazo do some real complicated stuff on your behalf: it writes XSLT!

But sometimes basic rules are not enough and you need to write a bit of XLST your self.


Modify the theme and the content on the fly
--------------------------------------------

Let's see some example from the `official diazo docs <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/advanced.html#modifying-the-theme-on-the-fly>`_.


Extend rules
------------

You can `re-use or extend rules <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/advanced.html#xinclude>`_ from another theme or from another file in your theme.

A good example of a use case is the one described by `Asko Soukka <https://twitter.com/datakurre>`_  (thanks!!!) in this blog post about `how to  Customize Plone 5 default theme on the fly <http://datakurre.pandala.org/2015/05/customize-plone-5-default-theme-on-fly.html>`_.


Include external content
------------------------

You can `include external content <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/advanced.html#including-external-content>`_ from another website or from a custom view.


Recipes and snippets
--------------------

The docs provide `a basic recipe set <http://docs.diazo.org/en/latest/recipes/index.html>`_ and you can have your own, but how to remember and re-use them?

`David Bain introduces a "diazo snippets library" <http://blog.dbain.com/2014/12/introducing-diazo-snippets-library.html>`_ that allows you to get snippets from a chrome extensions. `All the snippets are available here <http://pigeonflight.github.io/lessArcane/>`_.
