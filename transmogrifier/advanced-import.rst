Advanced Pipeline Tips
======================

One of the most difficult things about Transmogrifier is being aware of everything that is possible.
There is a lot of manipulation that can be done in the pipleline, but it means you have to know what blueprints are available, and how to use them all.
When starting out, you may find yourself writing a lot more blueprints than is really necessary.
But this is ok, since migration code is generally only used once.

In this section, we'll cover some advanced tips of what is possible in the pipeline.

* multiple pipelines
  * https://docs.plone.org/external/collective.transmogrifier/docs/source/genericsetup.html
* see Ross's code
* import as upgrade step
* https://docs.plone.org/external/collective.transmogrifier/docs/source/sections.html
  * add a condition section that does the same thing as our example blueprint (excluding older items)
