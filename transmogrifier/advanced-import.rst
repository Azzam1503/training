Advanced Pipeline Tips
======================

One of the most difficult things about Transmogrifier is being aware of everything that is possible in the pipeline.
There is a lot of manipulation that can be done in the pipleline,
but it means you have to know what blueprints are available, and how to use them all.
When starting out, you may find yourself writing a lot more blueprints than is really necessary.
As you learn more about what is possible with the pipeline,
you may end up writing less custom code.

In this section, we'll cover some advanced tips of what is possible in the pipeline.

* multiple pipelines
  * https://docs.plone.org/external/collective.transmogrifier/docs/source/genericsetup.html
* plone.app.transmogrifier.datesupdater
* see Ross's code
* import as upgrade step
* https://docs.plone.org/external/collective.transmogrifier/docs/source/sections.html
  * add a condition section that does the same thing as our example blueprint (excluding older items)
