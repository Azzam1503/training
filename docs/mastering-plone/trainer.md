# Trainer: Preparation

Preparation of a Mastering Plone Development Training

You are about to give a training. Here are some tips what to prepare before.


## Technical set up to do before a training

- Prepare a mail server for the user registration mail (See {ref}`features-mailserver-label`)
- TODO update text for installtion with pip: In <https://github.com/collective/training_buildout> change [buildout.cfg](https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/master/buildout.cfg) to extend from the new `versions.cfg` on <https://dist.plone.org/release>.
- Check if we should update any versions in <https://github.com/collective/training_buildout/blob/master/versions.cfg>.
- If you do only a part of the training, prepare an installation with the steps of the previous chapters.
See {doc}`/mastering-plone/code` for more information.
