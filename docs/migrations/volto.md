# Migrate to Volto

See the chapter {ref}`plone6docs:backend-migrate-to-volto-label` of the Plone Upgrade Guide.

Issues:

* Complex html (e.g. in tables) is transformed to html-blocks
* There is no migration from Draftjs to Slate

* Alternatives
  * Start fresh
  * Use exportimport (TODO: https://github.com/collective/collective.exportimport/issues/133)
