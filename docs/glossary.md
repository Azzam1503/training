    Blocks display a chunk of HTML which can be inserted in your Plone pages.

element
    Elements are the dynamic components of your blocks.
    They can be input fields, buttons, or computed HTML.
    They can also return JSON if you call them from a JavaScript app.

record

    Records are basic dictionaries.

Project (Volto)
    The product of running `create-volto-app`, a customizable instance of Volto.

Add-on (Volto)
    A JavaScript package that integrates with Volto's configuration registry.

Add-on configuration loader (Volto)
    A function with signature `config => config`.

Configuration registry (Volto)
    A singleton object modeled using JavaScript modules, accessible from the Volto
    project using the `~/config` path.

Shadowing (Volto)
    Webpack provides an "alias" mechanism, where the path for a module can be aliased to another module.
    By using this mechanism Volto enables customization (file overrides), similar to `z3c.jbot.`

Razzle
    A tool that simplifies SPA and SSR configuration for React projects.

Webpack
    A tool that loads and bundles code and web resources using loaders.

Webpack entrypoint
    The main files generated by webpack as a result.
    They typically contain the application source code based on modules bundled together, but it can also include other resources, such as static resources.
    It can contain code to automatically trigger the load of other JavaScript code files called "chunks".

Babel
    A JavaScript compiler that "transpiles" newer standards JavaScript to something that any browser can load.

Express
    A JavaScript HTTP server with a simple API to build custom applications.
    Volto uses it as its server.

Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
    When first loading any Plone page, users will get HTML markup that closely matches the final DOM structure of the React components used to render that page.

Single Page Application (SPA)
    A type of JavaScript application that aims to provide a better user experience by avoiding unnecessary reloading of the browser page, instead using AJAX to load backend information.

Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
    A development feature provided by Webpack that automatically reloads, in the browser, the JavaScript modules that have changed on disk.

Yeoman
    A popular scaffolding tool similar to Plone's `mr.bob` or `ZopeSkel`.

CommonJS
    A JavaScript package standard, the equivalent of a Python wheel or egg.
    Enables JavaScript modules.

Transpilation
    The transformation of JavaScript code that uses advanced language features, unavailable for some browsers, to code rewritten to support them.

ES6
    ECMAScript 6, a newer version of the JavaScript language.

mrs-developer
    Also called "missdev", a tool similar to buildout's `mr.developer`.
    It automatically downloads and keeps up to date copies of software and add-ons under development based on definitions stored in `mrs.developer.json`.
    As a byproduct of its update operations, it also automatically adjusts `jsconfig.json`, which is used by Volto to configure webpack aliases.

Yarn
    A popular JavaScript package manager similar to NPM.

Hydration (SSR)
    After loading an HTML page generated with SSR in the browser, React can "populate" the existing DOM elements, recreate and attach their coresponding components.

JSX
    A dialect of JavaScript that resembles XML, it is transpiled by Babel to JavaScript functions.
    React uses JSX as its component templating.

Scoped packages
    Namespace for JavaScript packages, they provide a way to avoid naming conflicts for common package names.

middleware (Redux)
    Custom wrappers for the Redux store dispatch methods. 
    They allow customizing the behavior of the data flow inside the redux store.

hooks (React)
    Hooks are a React API that allow function components to use React features such as lifecycle methods, states, and so on.

hoisting (Yarn)
    An optimization provided by Yarn.
    By default JavaScript packages will directly include dependencies inside their local node_modules.
    By hoisting we're "lifting" these inner dependencies to the top level `node_modules` directory, and thus optimize the generated bundles.
    In case two dependencies have conflicting version dependencies of the same library, the hoisting will not be possible (for that conflicting dependency) and you'll see multiple instances of the same library in the bundle, or you'll see that the add-on receives its own `node_modules` folder.

React
    [React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
    Volto, the frontend for Plone 6, uses React.
