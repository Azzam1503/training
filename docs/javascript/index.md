## Training Objective

The most important objective of this training is to explain how to integrate JavaScript applications and integrations into Plone in different scenarios.

Secondly, it is to explain the JavaScript technologies used in Plone itself ([RequireJS](https://requirejs.org/), [Patterns](https://github.com/plone/plone.patternslib), [Resource registry](https://docs.plone.org/adapt-and-extend/theming/resourceregistry.html)).
