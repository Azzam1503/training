# Project requirements

Our hands-on exercise is to (re)build this (to be honest a bit older) version of [plone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20210813064319/https://plone.com/) using Volto.
This is what the page looks like:

```{image} _static/plone.com_index.png
:align: center
:alt: plone.org theme
```

## Tasks

These are the tasks we will go through:

- Set up CSS basics
- Create the header and the footer
- Create a main slider
- Develop a view for the Success Story content type
- Create a three-column highlights center element

We'll leave these tasks for later:

- creating a five element row
- showing the list of sponsors
- developing the "prefooter"
- showing a list of Success Story content items

## Training ressources and assets

There are a few Files, mostly images, that you will need to recreate the plone.org page. They are currently available from this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xDleXE8Emhr9xn_pnZaGfO9_HmU31L9e?usp=sharing)
