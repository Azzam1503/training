## How To Give Technical Trainings

```{warning}
WORK IN PROGRESS

This chapter will likely only interest you if you want to **give a (Plone)technical training**,
it does not contain any material on Plone itself.
```

It's not specifically written for Mastering Plone but could be useful in giving any technical training.
Hopefully it will support you for your first Plone educational experience in front of the room.

It contains feedback and 'lessons learned' from previous Plone trainings and personal experience.
