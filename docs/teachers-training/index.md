# Teaching

## Using the documentation for a training

Feel free to organize a training yourself.
Please be so kind to contribute any bug fixes or enhancements you made to the documentation for your training: {doc}`/contributing/index`

## Complete Mode and compact Presentation Mode

The training is rendered using Sphinx and builds in two flavors:

default
: The verbose version used for the online documentation and for the trainer.
: Build it in Sphinx with `make html` or use the online version.

presentation
: An abbreviated version used for the projector during a training.
: It should use more bullet points than verbose text.
: Build it in Sphinx with `make presentation`.


## Setup Environment

See {doc}`/contributing/setup-author` for instructions on how to set up the training documentation locally.

## How To Give Technical Trainings

```{warning}
WORK IN PROGRESS

This chapter will likely only interest you if you want to **give a (Plone) technical training**,
it does not contain any material on Plone itself.
```

It's not specifically written for Plone but could be useful in giving any technical training.
Hopefully it will support you for your first Plone educational experience in front of the room.

It contains feedback and 'lessons learned' from previous Plone trainings and personal experience.
