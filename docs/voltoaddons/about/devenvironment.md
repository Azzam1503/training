# Developer integration with text editors

[Visual Studio Code] provides a very good integration with the tooling used by
Volto. If you haven't done Javascript development with VSC so far, you should
check the [VisualStudio Code Javascript guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/javascript) as it provides a very detailed
overview of the capabilities and required configuration.

For Vim, check language integration packages such as [ALE] or [coc.nvim].
